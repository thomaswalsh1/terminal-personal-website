Final capstone project for the IBM Full Stack Developer Certification.
It is a mock car dealership website created using React, Django, MongoDB,
Microservices, and other tools. This website also includes AI
integration via microservices powered by Kubernetes.

Overall, this was a fun project. I learned a lot from the IBM Full Stack course in general.
