LinuxLearner is an open-source project I have been working on that allows
for the seamless practice and memorization of the commands featured in
the CompTIA Linux+ V8 exam. Built in primarily in C, LinuxLearner uses a
terminal-style GUI provided by the ncurses library to run the user through
different sets of exercises in their own shell.
