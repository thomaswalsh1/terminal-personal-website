My name is Thomas Walsh and I am a student at UMass Amherst (class of 2027).
I study Computer Science, and I also teach at the UMass BJJ Club sometimes.

I am interested in a lot of different fields right now, and I'm not sure
what I really want to do as a career. The Tech industry is changing rapidly, 
accelerated by the use of LLMs and Machine Learning.

Right now, I am interested in Linux SysAdmin, IT Infrastructure,
Cloud Engineering, Full Stack, UI/UX, and more!

Navigate through my terminal to learn more about what I do :)
